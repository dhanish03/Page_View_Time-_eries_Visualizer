# Page_View_Time-_eries_Visualizer
The Page View Time Series Visualizer project is designed to analyze and visualize time series data, specifically focusing on the daily page views of the freeCodeCamp.org forum over several years (from May 2016 to December 2019). It creates visualizations that help in identifying trends, seasonality, and growth in page views over time.
